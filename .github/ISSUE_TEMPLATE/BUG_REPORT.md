# **How to write a bug report**

Below is a short summary of what to include for each component of a full bug report.

## Clear title

A moderator should be able to understand what the bug report is about from the title alone.

## Actual results

This section should expand on the title by stating the behaviour observed when the issue occurs.

## Expected results

The Expected results section should state on how the app should behave according to the expected behaviour.

> *E.g: The authorization phase completes successfully, the user is logged into the newly created account and redirected to the home page of the app.*  

## Steps to reproduce

The Steps to reproduce section should list each step required to reproduce the bug in chronological order.

## Severity of the bug

We use 5 categories to identify the severity of the bug.

- **Critical**: The bug prevents critical functionality within the app from working. This includes crashing, freezing for which no workaround is possible and a fix is required immediately.
- **High**: The bug affects major functionality within the app from working. However, high priority bugs can be avoided with a workaround.
- **Medium**: The bug does not cause a failure and does not interfere with the fluent work of the system and programs. It has an easy workaround.
- **Low**: The bug does not affect functionality or data, or require a workaround. It is a result of non-conformance to a standard that does not impact productivity: typing errors/ aesthetic inconsistencies.
- **Usability**: A suggestion that would improve how an app is understood, learnt and used efficiently.

## Device and Operating System

Each bug report must include details of the specific device and operating system you used during the test to identify the bug.

## Screenshots / Other Notes

- Include necessary and relevant evidence to show the problem your are describing. Evidence includes: screenshots, videos, crash or console logs (for crashes).
- Crashes and freezes should always include a video and console/crash logs.
- Bugs with more than multiple steps to reproduce usually require a video.
